##What is this?

This is an analysis of data from the Strategic Subject List (SSL), an algorithm used by the Chicago Policde Department to assign a risk score of an individual becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence. The SSL assigned a risk score to every Chicagoan with an arrest history prior to September of 2019, when its use was formally retired.


##What can I find here?

The [raw SSL data in CSV format](Strategic_Subject_List.csv).

The [clean SSL data in CSV format](FILL ME).

An [Rmd](ssl.Rmd) with my analysis of the SSL data.

An [md](ssl.md) also with my analysis of the SSL data.

##Where did this data come from?

The data in this repo was loaded in an R-friendly csv format created by the good folks of [RSocrata](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/blob/master/README.md), a group of data scientists employed by the City of Chicago.

SSL data is also available in other formats on the the [City of Chicago's Data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Strategic-Subject-List/4aki-r3np).
